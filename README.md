## Getting Started

To use this project, you'll need to do the following:

* Clone this repository onto your computer or upload it to heroku.

* If you're running it locally on your pc, also perform these steps:

    * run `npm i` from the terminal (this will install the npm modules: dotenv, bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, passport, sequelize and validator)
    * create the mysql database using the `schema.sql` file
    * create a `.env` file with your MySQL Database password in the following format 
     (this was included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent the password from being exposed on Github):
    ```
    DB_PASSWORD="your_database_password_here"
    ```

This file will be imported by `config/index.js` while running on your computer locally because of the following changes to the `config/index.js` file.

    ```js
    let sequelize;
    if (config.use_env_variable) {
        sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env[config.use_env_variable], config);
    } else {
        // assign the local password from the `.env` to a new password variable. 
        const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
        sequelize = new Sequelize(config.database, config.username,/*config.password is now*/ password, config);
    }
    ```

* run 'server.js' to dynamically create the required tables
* seed the newly created database tables with the `seeds.sql` file
